**The Bechdel Test: Analyzing gender disparity in Hollywood**

### Using data analytic techniques to visualize gender inequality in Hollywood


**What is the Bechdel test?**

The Bechdel test is named after cartoonist Alison Bechdel, who introduced the idea in a comic strip in the year 1985. To pass the test, a story needs to have:
* At least two women
* The women need to talk to each other
* They need to talk to each other about something other than a man

After doing some reading on the Bechdel test, I was struck with inspiration. I decided to conduct data analysis on movie datasets to check whether or not they passed the test!


**## The Data Question**

My aim was to collect data from various different sources, and answer the following questions about the Bechdel test:

* Have the Bechdel scores of movies improved over the years?
* Do movies with higher IMDB ratings have higher Bechdel scores?
* Do movies with female directors have higher Bechdel scores?



I collected data from three different sources: *bechdeltest.com and this movies dataset.*


**I managed to visualize relationships and answer all the data questions I set out to find answers to.** 

Some interesting data findings include:

* Movies that fail the Bechdel test tend to have higher IMDB ratings.
* Over the years, there has been an increasing number of movies that pass the Bechdel test.
